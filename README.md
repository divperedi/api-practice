# API Practice

This repository is my personal learning project where I am exploring API handling techniques using promises and async functions. I am also trying to work with JavaScript modules to make my code more organized and modular.

## API Handling

In this project, I am learning various techniques for handling APIs. I am using promises and async functions to make asynchronous API calls and trying my best to handle the responses efficiently.

## JavaScript Modules

To make my code more modular and organized, I am experimenting with JavaScript modules. I am splitting my code into separate files and using import/export functionality as needed.

## Contributing

I am open to contributions! As I am still learning, any suggestions or improvements are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
